With Story Planner, users can organize their ideas, notes, and plot points on timelines, enabling them to develop compelling stories with clarity and coherence.

+ **Edit and Delete**: Users have complete control over their timelines and notes. They can edit the content, titles, or descriptions of both timelines and individual notes. Furthermore, they can delete unwanted timelines or notes effortlessly.

+ **Multiple Timelines**: Story Planner allows users to work on multiple storylines simultaneously. Writers and storymakers can switch between different timelines, ensuring efficient management of diverse narrative elements.

+ **Title and Description**: Users can add titles to timelines and notes, providing a clear overview of each timeline's purpose or note's content. This feature allows for better organization and understanding of the story's structure.

+ Tags (Coming Soon): In a future update, Story Planner will introduce the ability to assign tags to timelines and notes, enabling users to categorize and filter their story elements based on themes, characters, or plot points.
